# Script: rename
# Description: Renames all files in a given directory by
#              appending a leader name and a padded index.
#
# Usage:
#   ./rename <directory> <leader_name>
#
# Parameters:
#   <directory>   - Path to the directory containing files to rename
#   <leader_name> - The prefix to use for each renamed file
#
# What it does:
#   - Goes through all files (not subdirectories) in the specified directory
#   - Renames each file to <leader_name>_XXX.ext (e.g., Leader_001.jpg)
#   - Preserves the original file extensions
#   - Outputs the renaming progress to the terminal
#
# Example:
#   $ ./rename ./images Leader
#   Renaming './images/pic.jpg' to 'Leader_001.jpg'...
#   Renaming './images/photo.png' to 'Leader_002.png'...
#   Renaming complete. Total files renamed: 2

    mv "$f" "$dir/$new_name"
